        <h2>COVID-19 Safety Guidelines</h2>
        <p>As we navigate through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it's crucial to follow safety guidelines to protect yourself and those around you. Here are some important safety measures to consider:</p>
        <!-- Safety Guidelines (list updated) -->
        <ul>
            <li>Wear a Mask: Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth in public places helps prevent the spread of respiratory droplets and reduces the risk of transmission.</li>
            <li>Practice Social Distancing: Maintain a safe distance (at least 6 feet) from individuals who do not live in your household. Avoid crowded places whenever possible.</li>
            <li>Frequent Handwashing: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds regularly. If soap is unavailable, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
            <li>Stay Informed: Stay updated with reliable information from health authorities. Knowledge about the latest guidelines and developments is essential.</li>
            <li>Get Vaccinated: Getting vaccinated is a crucial step in ending the pandemic. Follow your local vaccination schedule and encourage others to do the same.</li>
            <li>Avoid Touching Your Face: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands to minimize the risk of virus transmission from surfaces.</li>
            <li>Stay Home If Sick: If you feel unwell or exhibit COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, or loss of taste or smell, stay home to prevent potential spread.</li>
            <li>Follow Local Guidelines: Adhere to local regulations and guidelines regarding lockdowns, curfews, and public gatherings. Your cooperation is vital in controlling the virus's spread.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Dietary Recommendations (list updated) -->
        <h2>Dietary Recommendations If You Are Affected by COVID-19</h2>
        <p>If you or someone you know has contracted COVID-19, nutrition plays a crucial role in recovery. A well-balanced diet can help boost your immune system and aid in the healing process. Here are dietary recommendations to consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration is essential. Drink plenty of water, herbal teas, and clear broths to stay hydrated, especially if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.</li>
            <li>Eat a Variety of Fruits and Vegetables: Consume a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables to provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support your immune system.</li>
            <li>Include Protein-Rich Foods: Lean protein sources like poultry, fish, tofu, beans, and legumes are important for tissue repair and maintaining muscle mass.</li>
            <li>Opt for Whole Grains: Choose whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat bread for sustained energy and essential nutrients.</li>
            <li>Incorporate Healthy Fats: Include sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil in your diet to support overall health.</li>
            <li>Avoid Excessive Sugar and Processed Foods: Avoid or limit sugary and highly processed foods and beverages, as they can weaken the immune system and hinder recovery.</li>
            <li>Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to your body's cues. If you experience a loss of appetite, try eating smaller, more frequent meals to ensure adequate nutrition.</li>
            <li>Consult a Healthcare Professional: If you have severe symptoms or dietary concerns, consult a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs.</li>
        </ul>
